"Price and frictions in the market for IPv4 addresses"

*Abstract*: In this paper I study the evolution of prices and frictions in the market for IPv4 addresses. Each IPv4 address being a durable, homogenous resource has zero fundamental value once the standard changes from IPv4 to IPv6. Yet in the market a striking empirical feature has been the rising prices IPv4 prices. At the same IPv6 adoption has been lagging for over two decades. First I lay out the key empirical features of this industry, develop a dynamic model of firm behavior in the IPv4 market and IPv6 adoption decisions. I estimate the model parameters using simulated method of moments and predict rising price and IPv6 adoption pattern. In counterfactual simulations, I find that switching and adjustment costs raise prices and delay IPv6 adoption. I find that in the absence of network effects firms would adopt IPv6 almost immediately.
